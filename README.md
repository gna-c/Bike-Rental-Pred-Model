# Prediction Model for Bike Rental Counts based on Environmental & Temporal Factors in Washington DC
- Constructed a predictive model to estimate bike rental counts in Washington D.C., leveraging regression techniques and performance metrics.
- Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Tidyverse tools to understand data patterns and identify issues.
- Tackled multicollinearity by eliminating features with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values, ensuring more reliable model estimates.
- Employed an Exhaustive Search method to streamline feature selection, cutting down the variable set from 20 to 13 without compromising model accuracy. Evaluation was based on criteria like Adjusted `R²`, Mallow’s `Cₚ`, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
